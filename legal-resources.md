# Legal Resources

Made with ðŸ’œ by Janneke Parrish & Cher Scarlett

Please note that this document is not meant as a replacement for seeking legal advice, and that individual states and countries have different resources. We have labelled resources by their country and state. 

Your NDA does not prevent you from reaching out to these resources, or from consulting with an attorney. We have also included a list of attorneys we have had good experiences with.

### With all resources listed here, we recommend the following:
1. Document everything. The more documentation you have - be it e-mails, witnesses, paper, etc. - the better.
2. Establish a clear timeline. Establishing a timeline supported by documentation makes a case stronger.
3. Speak to an attorney in your area. We are able to provide generic resources. An attorney in your area can provide better guidance.
