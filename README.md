## Introduction

### Even just one story is too many

Sharing our stories is the first step in seeing the patterns of abuse & any systems in place to allow them continue. Only when we share our stories do we begin to understand we are not alone and begin to heal.

We have the power of numbers; the power in testimony and solidarity.

If you don't feel comfortable sharing your story, or aren't sure if you have one, you can still connect with us through the form.

## Current or past workers can use this form to share a short story about harassment, racism, sexism, discrimination, retaliation, and/or other abusive behavior they faced or witnessed.

You may also decline to share a story and get involved in other ways, including just being notified about what we are doing to help workers.

## 1. Do you want to share your story with us?

## 2. Do you consent to your story being shared anonymously & respectfully?
