# Press Advice

1. First and foremost, you can speak to whoever you choose to. You are legally allowed to speak about workplace issues without violating your NDA. This is protected by multiple legal entities. We caution you to not name names, use “leadership”, or “management”, or “colleagues”. We further caution you to not mention Apple products, or speak on behalf of Apple. 

2. Before naming anyone else involved in the effort, please get their permission. Preferably, give any journalist or press information to the person you think may be interested in speaking to the press, instead of giving the press their information. This allows folks to opt-in to consent, rather than opting out.

3. Please do not share any unfinished documents or efforts outside of the group before we are, as a group, ready to share it publicly.

4. You can speak on the record, quoted, or off the record as background anonymously. A good journalist will respect this. You can also request to have any quotes run by you, and request information only be used to confirm or dig deeper into an issue. Again, a good journalist will respect this.

5. We’ve compiled a list of vetted journalists that we have felt comfortable speaking to about workplace issues. We have also spoken with these journalists about our own Apple stories and this initiative. They are all working on longform, thoughtful stories and would be honored to share your stories and help you seek remedy and validation.
